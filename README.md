# advent-of-code-2023

I'm attempting Advent of Code 2023 using Rust. I'm pretty new to Rust so this is a really good opportunity to learn and have some fun!

I will be unit-testing all functions and prioritizing functionality over speed - if I get the right answer without having to wait half an hour I'll call that a success!

## Problem 1

This was a fairly simple problem but allowed me to understand the basics of unit-testing in Rust, as well as simple loops, looping over strings, casting strings to integers, and variable assignment for mutable and non-mutable variables. 

I don't fully understand the borrow checker yet, but that will come with time & research. I also didn't fully understand the .expect("" )
