# advent-of-code-2023

I'm attempting Advent of Code 2023 using Rust. I'm pretty new to Rust so this is a really good opportunity to learn and have some fun!

I will be unit-testing all functions and prioritizing functionality over speed - if I get the right answer without having to wait half an hour I'll call that a success!
